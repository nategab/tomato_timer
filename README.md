# tomato_timer
This project includes two scripts for a digital tomato timer - one for the Raspberry Pi and one for the CPX

Tomato timers are associated with the "Pomodoro Method" of staying focused on work. It's popular with grad students who have trouble writing their dissertations.

Both of these scripts use red LEDs to 'count' tomatoes, and green and blue LEDs to indicate progress. See my write-up of the method and my experience with it at http://nategabriel.com/egblog/hardware-and-software-projects/tomato-timer/
